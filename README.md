I am a first year student studying computer science and this is my first project ever - Song guessing game
It plays a song based on the genre and language you select and you have 6 chances to guess the song.
If you guess the song in the first go, you will score the maximum points i.e. 6, if in second chance, you will get 5 points and so on.
If you don't know the song and skip until the end or haven't got it right until the last chance, you will end up losing with 0 points.
For english, there are 4 difficulty levels - easy, medium, hard and deadly but for other languages just two levels - normal and deadly
Difficulty level can be interpreted as the duration the song will be played initially, for example, if the level chosen in easy, it will play for 5 seconds
in other cases the duration will keep on decreasing.
I have also included genres in English as some people might listen to a particular genre more and hence be good at guessing it.
